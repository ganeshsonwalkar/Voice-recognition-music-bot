# Voice-recognized-music-bot
A voice recognized python program that will search the song on YouTube and will play it for you.
This program will help any kind of people to play song without having to give input manually.
All you need is to say some words.
Its a better solution for old age people as its easy to use and dont need much input in order to listen to their favourite songs.
Because of voice recognition theres no complex UI for those who are not familiar with applications and computers in general.
The idea behind making this is to help old age people to listen to favourite songs to keep them mentally happy and active.
As these people have alot less things to do leading to boredom and unhealthy boring life.
Music will keep them happy and cheerful all the time.
As we all know music acts a therapy and helps with the mood.
